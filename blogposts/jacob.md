Jacob’s team has been handling around 30 software subscriptions with Zenskar for over a year.

## What difference does it make.

Because, despite having to slash headcount during tough times, Jacob’s team maintained its software stack and even signed up for Zenskar to manage it all. That demonstrates how crucial software is to a tech business. 

**"I would have no hesitation in recommending Zenskar to businesses of our size and larger." It fulfills all of your requirements and pays for itself. It's fantastic."**, Jacob says


## Keeping everything in one spot.

**"We have front and back-end teams, product people, project managers, and so on..." "And everyone has their own way of working and software,"** Jacob explains.

And, like many other businesses, Jacob told us that they didn't have a procedure in place for deciding which software to utilize.
As a result, Jacob's team didn't have the opportunity to examine and comprehend simple facts like what software they had at the time, who owned it, and how much money they spent.


## How Zenskar helped ?

"**When we first brought Zenskar on, we immediately became aware of our monthly expenditure, who was spending, what we needed to continue moving, what we could cancel instantly,"** he explains. It was a significant step forward."

**"With Zenskar, all the maintenance and internal audits are done in a matter of minutes,"** said Jacob.
