Alohaâ€™s first step in embarking on the adventure of launching  her company was to obtain a Zenskar subscription.

Zenskar assisted her in managing her SaaS subscription stack at her prior company, where she oversaw finance.
Some may believe that taking control of SaaS subscriptions right away when beginning a business is not a priority. Teams remain small, processes are constrained, and little software is employed

Aloha, you see, is ahead of the game.
**"With a tool like Zenskar, you have much more visibility on subscriptions, which gives you that control you need and prevents that 'clean up operation' from occurring later, when things have gotten out of hand."**


## Managing SaaS chaos from the beginning.

Aloha had witnessed firsthand the consequences of poor SaaS management at her previous company and didn't want to repeat the same mistake.  She brought Zenskar on as soon as possible.

## How  Zenskar helped ?

## Easy Integrations

**"It was a no-brainer to sign up with Zenskar. I've seen software subscriptions grow up in previous organizations, and once you notice the problem, you suddenly find yourself with a large bill and antiquated processes that you wish you had monitored from the start."**

Aloha now not only has complete control over her business software, but she also has a method for avoiding duplicates and properly managing expenditures.

## Eliminating the risk of going over budget

One of the most important aspects of finance is maintaining control over spending and ensuring that those costs are understood.

And software is a significant component of that conundrum. **"Going over your software budget is a big problem, especially in a startup,"** Aloha says.
