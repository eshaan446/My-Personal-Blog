## Introduction
The software industry is shifting away from typical yearly enterprise sales cycles. Customers want greater transparency and control over what they spend, and fewer businesses are ready to sign multi-year seat-based contracts. In general, the main concerns of software buyers in recent years have been cost reduction and avoiding unnecessary spending whenever possible. In this context, sales teams must be able to explain and quantify the value they provide with as much precision and specificity as possible. The days of sales teams focusing solely on closing transactions and then moving on to the next customer are long gone with usage-based pricing. 

## What is usage-based pricing ?

Usage-based pricing is a pricing model used by B2B (Business-to-Business) SaaS (product as a Service) companies in which clients are charged based on their actual usage of the product or service. This pricing approach differs from standard flat-rate or subscription-based pricing models in which customers pay a fixed charge regardless of how frequently they use the product. Usage-based pricing is frequently utilized in instances where the value of the product or service increases with its use.

The rise of usage-based pricing is shifting this paradigm. Now, customers can dynamically change how much or how little they use a service; put another way, customers can take control of their spending based on the actual value being realized (represented by usage), and long-term contracts without usage conditions are going by the wayside. Next-generation sales teams must weaponize real-time product usage data to track the health of customer accounts and to inform data-driven decisions on how to intelligently engage with the customer base.

## How to leverage Metered Usage Data?

As the customers are preferring to pay for what they use over large subscriptions, sales staff require new tools to thrive in their professions. The solution to being successful in this new buying environment is real-time and precise metering of product usage data. Sales and customer success teams can identify client groups and usage patterns, determine which features and capabilities are most widely used, and uncover sources of friction in the product by measuring and analyzing customer activity in real time. This data, accumulated over time, provides a detailed picture of each client account and can provide crucial insights for continued interaction. 

Furthermore, while considering pipeline items and product enhancements, the product and engineering teams should use consumer usage statistics as a reference. Today, real-time usage data is a neglected asset throughout the corporate landscape; in fact, most firms without usage-based pricing do not even measure consumption at a granular level.
